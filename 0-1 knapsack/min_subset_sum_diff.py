# Sum of subset differences
# Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
# If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
#
# Example:
# Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5}
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
# Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
